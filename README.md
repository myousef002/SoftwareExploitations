# Software Exploitation Database
A database of different software exploitations throughout the years with explanations and code (As I learn about them).

In each of the folders is a different way to exploit common coding mistakes. Included in each folder is a C file with a vulnerability, an executable binary file, and one solution.
It is important to know that in order to have similar results run the code on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine.
